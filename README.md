# workout-tracker

## Project Description

The Workout-Tracker allows a user to add workout information and that data will be stored and presented in a graph form. The user will be able to create a new workout and choose from cardio or resistance. The user can then add all the additional details of their workout. This data will be stored in MongoDB database and then presented on the "dashboard" page of the application. The user can then see the data from their excercises displayed in a graph. The application utilizes Javascript, HTML, MongoDB, Node JS, CSS and Heroku to allow it to function.
